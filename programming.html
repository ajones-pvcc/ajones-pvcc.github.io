        <h1>Chapter 5: Programming Algorithms & Software Testing</h1>
        <h3>Phases of computer program development:</h3>
        <ul>
	        <li><b>Phase 1:</b>Understand the problem</li>
            <li><b>Phase 2:</b>Design an algorithm to solve the problem</li>
            <li><b>Phase 3:</b>Write the program code in appropriate language based on the algorithm</li>
            <li><b>Phase 4:</b>Enter the program and save</li>
            <li><b>Phase 5:</b>Execute the program</li>
	        <li><b>Phase 6:</b>Test the program, find errors and debug, then retest</li>
            <li><b>Phase 7:</b>Document and evaluate the program</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Programming structures:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Sequential structure:</b>Top-down execution</li>
            <li><b>Decision structures:</b>if/then/else</li>
            <li><b>Iteractive (Looping):</b></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>while loop: continue looping until something is true</li>
                    <li>repeat/until loop: continue looping until something is true</li>
                    <li>for loop: loop a given number of times</li>
                </ol>
            <li><b>Recursive structures:</b></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself</li>
                    <li>Repetition continues until:</li>
                </ol>
                    degenerative case, which is a termination condition, is met<br>
                    (degenerative case is also called a "base case")
        </ul>
        <h3>Two classic programming/database problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Sorting:</b>Descending order/Ascending order</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Sorting numbers</li>
                <li>Sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values)</li>
            </ol>
            <li><b>Searching:</b>find specific data that meet a certain criteria</li>
                <li><b>In database:</b></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Filters: temoporary search</li>
                    <li>Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated</li>
                </ol>
            <li><b>Two popular search techniques:</b></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Sequential search: search from top to bottom or  bottom to top, one item at a time</li>
                <li>Binary search:</li>
            </ol>
                only works if data is SORTED first<br>
                start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.
        </ul>
        <h3>Two classic program goals:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Efficiency:</b>Program takes minimal time and/or resources</li>
            <li><b>Correctness:</b>Program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions</li>
        </ul>
